Scan the project and update documentation to reflect current state.

## Tasks

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with:
   - Current phase progress
   - Completed features
   - What's working
   - Next steps

2. **Update README.md** (if exists) with:
   - Project description
   - Setup instructions
   - Usage examples

3. **Check PROJECT_BRIEF.md** against actual progress and note any drift

## Guidelines

- Keep docs concise and accurate
- Don't add fluff or marketing language
- Focus on what's implemented, not what's planned
- Update phase status based on actual code
